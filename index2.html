        <p> Once upon a time, there was a lonely baby polar bear in Antartica.
          He had lost his parents after the house melted away, and he was
          in desperate search for a new home. </p>

        <p> On the day of the biggest shooting star, the lonely baby polar bear wished
          for an icy shelter to keep him cold, soft creamy cushion with a ball pit
            for him to play in. </p>

        <p> To his surprise, there was an icy cold mountain of soda cream cushion with
          cherry syrup streaks with popping candies! </p>
